# [Avoidantdesktoppet] üéØ

### Project Description
[This is a simple, playful Python project that creates a cartoon pet on your desktop. The pet constantly watches your mouse, and when you try to get close to it ‚Äî it jumps away and plays a sound! It does nothing useful, but it's a fun way to learn about GUI programming, real-time mouse tracking, and basic animation in Python.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People have been struggling for too long with desktop pets that don‚Äôt fear them. They sit still, they wait for you, they trust you.
But what if your pet didn‚Äôt want your love? What if it actively ran away from you?

Enter the Avoidant Desktop Pet ‚Äî a project designed to solve this entirely imaginary problem. It dodges your mouse pointer, jumps around your screen, and makes a goofy sound ‚Äî because sometimes, software doesn‚Äôt need a purpose.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We proudly present a desktop companion that avoids you.
It doesn‚Äôt help.
It doesn‚Äôt listen.
It doesn‚Äôt stay.
It just jumps away ‚Äî with a boing!]
