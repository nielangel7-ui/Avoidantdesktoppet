# Avoidantdesktoppet
This is a simple, playful Python project that creates a cartoon pet on your desktop. The pet constantly watches your mouse, and when you try to get close to it â€” it jumps away and plays a sound! It does nothing useful, but it's a fun way to learn about GUI programming, real-time mouse tracking, and basic animation in Python.
